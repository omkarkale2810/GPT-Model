Fine-tuning a GPT Model on Instruction Data
This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained GPT-2 model on an instruction-following dataset. The goal is to adapt the model to better understand and respond to various instructions and prompts.

Project Overview
The project covers the following steps:

Data Loading and Preparation: Downloading and loading an instruction dataset.
Data Formatting: Converting the instruction data into a format suitable for training the language model (Alpaca format).
Custom Dataset and DataLoader: Implementing a custom PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader to handle the instruction data with appropriate padding and masking for training.
Loading a Pre-trained GPT Model: Loading a pre-trained GPT-2 model (specifically the medium size in this case) and its weights.
Fine-tuning the Model: Training the pre-trained model on the prepared instruction dataset using a simple training loop.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the fine-tuned model's performance on a test set and comparing its responses to the correct outputs.
Saving the Fine-tuned Model: Saving the state dictionary of the fine-tuned model.
Data
The project uses the instruction-data.json dataset, which contains pairs of instructions, optional inputs, and desired outputs.

Model
The project utilizes a pre-trained GPT-2 medium model. The architecture includes:

Token and positional embeddings.
Multiple Transformer blocks with Multi-Head Attention and FeedForward layers.
Layer normalization.
A final linear layer for outputting logits over the vocabulary.
Custom Components
download_and_load_file: A function to download and load data from a URL.
format_input: Formats instruction and input into a single string for the model.
InstructionDataset: A PyTorch Dataset for handling the encoded instruction data.
custom_collate_fn: A custom collate function for the DataLoader to handle padding and masking of sequences.
CausalAttention and MultiHeadAttention: Implementations of attention mechanisms.
LayerNorm, GELU, and FeedForward: Implementations of standard neural network layers.
TransformerBlock: Represents a single layer of the Transformer model.
