ðŸ“˜ Fine-Tuning GPT-2 on Instruction Data
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on an instruction-following dataset, enabling the model to better understand and respond to various prompts and tasks.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This repository walks through the complete fine-tuning pipeline:

Data Loading and Preparation

Download and load an instruction dataset.

Data Formatting

Convert raw instruction data into Alpaca-style format (instruction, optional input, and output).

Custom Dataset and DataLoader

Create a PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader with proper padding and attention masking.

Model Loading

Load the pre-trained GPT-2 (medium) model and weights.

Fine-Tuning

Train the model on the instruction dataset using a custom training loop.

Evaluation

Evaluate the model's responses against a test set.

Saving the Model

Save the fine-tuned model's state dictionary for future use.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The project uses instruction-data.json, which contains:

instruction

Optional input

Desired output

ðŸ§  Model Details
The model used is GPT-2 Medium, which includes:

Token and positional embeddings

Multiple Transformer blocks with:

Multi-head self-attention

Feedforward layers

Layer normalization

Final linear projection layer for logits

ðŸ§ª Getting Started
ðŸ”§ Prerequisites
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch numpy tiktoken tqdm
ðŸ“¥ Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
